This README organizes the tasks into related topics, provides a brief explanation of each task, and includes their time and space complexity.

## Topics and Tasks

### 1. Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method to solve problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing its result.

    - Problem: Compute the nth Tribonacci number, where each number is the sum of the previous three numbers.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

- **Task509: Fibonacci with Memoization**
    - Problem: Compute the nth Fibonacci number using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n) for memoization table.

- **Task70: Climbing Stairs**
    - Problem: Determine the number of distinct ways to climb a staircase of `n` steps.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

- **Task746: Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs**
    - Problem: Find the minimum cost to reach the top of a staircase, given costs for each step.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)

### 2. Mathematics / Combinatorics
Combinatorics deals with counting, arrangements, and combinations of elements.

- **Task119: Pascal's Triangle II**
    - Problem: Generate the kth row of Pascal's Triangle.
    - Time Complexity: O(k)

### 4. Two Pointer Techniques
The two-pointer technique involves using two indices to traverse a data structure, often to solve problems efficiently.

- **Task392: Is Subsequence**
    - Problem: Check if a string is a subsequence of another string.
    - Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the strings.
    - Space Complexity: O(1)

### 5. Bit Manipulation or Counting
Bit manipulation involves working with binary representations of numbers for efficient computation.

- **Task338: Counting Bits**
    - Problem: Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of all numbers from 0 to n.
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
